# Would you Rather App

A web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The user is asked a question “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?” where the user can choose any of the options and view the votes for the opted option. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. 

It's built with React, Redux, React Router, & Redux Thunk.
